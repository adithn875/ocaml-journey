## 👤 About Me

I'm **Adith**, a B.E. graduate in AI & Data Science (2026) from Bengaluru, India.

I started this repository with **zero OCaml knowledge** and a clear goal — land a role at an OCaml-heavy company like Jane Street or Tarides. Every single day I write OCaml, learn something new, and push it here.

This repo is my public proof of work.

## 🎯 Goal

> Become proficient enough in OCaml to contribute to production-grade functional systems and land a role at **Jane Street**, **Tarides**, or similar OCaml-focused companies.

## 🏆 Week 1 Project — Shopping Cart

A fully functional shopping cart built using every concept from Week 1.

```ocaml
(* Tuple-based product type *)
let make_item name price qty = (name, price, qty)

(* Higher order — total cost using fold *)
let cart_total items =
  List.fold_left (fun acc item -> acc +. item_total item) 0.0 items

(* Option type — safe item search *)
let rec find_item name items =
  match items with
  | [] -> None
  | (n, p, q) :: tail ->
    if n = name then Some (n, p, q)
    else find_item name tail
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Add and list items
- ✅ Calculate total cost
- ✅ Safe item search with `Option` types
- ✅ Filter items by price
- ✅ Formatted print output

## 💡 Key Insights So Far

**1. Types are everything**
OCaml's type system catches bugs before your program runs. No more runtime surprises.

**2. Pattern matching > if/else**
Matching on the shape of data is cleaner, exhaustive, and compiler-verified.

**3. Recursion over loops**
No `for` or `while` — recursion with a base case is how you think in OCaml.

**4. Options over null**
`None` and `Some x` force you to handle missing values explicitly. No null pointer crashes.

**5. Immutability by default**
Records don't mutate — you create new ones with `{ r with field = value }`. Predictable, safe code.

## 📈 Why OCaml?

- Used at **Jane Street** for all trading systems
- Used at **Tarides** for MirageOS and developer tools
- **Type safe** — compiler catches errors humans miss
- **Functional** — no side effects, no surprises
- **Fast** — compiles to native code, close to C performance

## 🔥 Daily Commitment

Every day I:
1. Create a new `.ml` file for the day's concept
2. Test everything in `utop`
3. Push to this repo with a meaningful commit message

No days off. No half commits. Just consistent progress.
